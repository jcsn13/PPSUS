# About the repository

With the emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing need for rapid testing to accelerate the isolation process and contain the spread of the disease. Hence, new approaches to testing are being developed, experimented, and enhanced. In this proejct, it's explored Machine Learning along with the Protein Computational Drawing state-of-the-art software called Rosetta can be applied to help the development of COVID-19 diagnose testing. The full PPSUS project is divided in the following steps:

- [x]  Gather protein data 
- [ ] Binding Energy
	- [x]  Develop a protein-protein interaction free energy of binding predictor
	- [ ]  Build an automated Machine Learning pipeline for the protein-protein interaction free energy of binding predictor
	- [ ]  Deploy a protein-protein interaction free energy of binding predictor
- [ ] Solubility
	- [ ]  Develop a protein solubility predictor
- [ ] Docking
	- [ ]  Develop a protein docking predictor
